# BenMAPR
Like EPA's BenMAP, but in R

This program is in multiple components:

1) BenMAPR Census Data – downloads US Census Data from the US Census Bureau using their API - THIS REQUIRES A US CENSUS API KEY
2) BenMAPR Health Data – processes and merges data available from BenMAP
3) Run BenMAPR – merge population and health data with CMAQ runs to produce health impact/benefit estimates.
